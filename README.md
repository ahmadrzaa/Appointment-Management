The Appointment Management System is a web application that allows users to schedule, manage, and view appointments. It provides an easy-to-use interface for clients to book and keep track of appointments. Below is a simplified outline for creating an Appointment Management System using React JS.


Users can book an appointment and view a list of all appointments. Ability to add, edit, and delete appointments. In this project, I have a state that stores appointment variables like name, date, etc., and when we update the name and date it is responsible for state management.![appointment-management-system](https://github.com/ahmadrzaa/Appointment-Management/assets/43694428/c80e7005-618c-4a75-aa84-cdc628da3e8c)
